# Reasons for the fork.
I fully realise that Delphi is long past its prime but back in the 2000s I did a bunch of Audio and video work in Delphi for various projects that is still very relivent I found this package to be an extreemly stable base to work from. Im forking this to be able to build a bunch of the old componets into network accessable elements as I have recently involved myself in the LPFM space and having access to many of the tools I built years ago is super useful. Any changes I make here are 100% as is but no attribution requrired if lake of soft wants to take them/spins up the library as licensed again (thanks for the support over they years). I need to do further thinking on how to handle licensing for any changes I make/distribute. The tools I will be putting out here are the same ones that are required for professional Radio/TV Broadcast. In the non commercial and sub 100k per year space there isnt a lot of vendor support happening to keep these stations on the air so compiled binaries are peachy. If the station/cluster/group grosses more then 100k anually or is valued at more then 1M then go buy professional gear so you have venders like telos that invest in the space. Im happy to chat if there is a gray area here. I reserve the right to retroactivly revise/revoke this toolchain at any point in the future for anybody except lake of soft.
